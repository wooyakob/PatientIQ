{"input": {"patient_id": "P001", "question": "What are evidence-based treatment options and practical next steps for this patient's condition?"}, "reference": "Rubric / expectations: Provide a clinically relevant, evidence-based answer tailored to the question and the patient's pulmonary condition. Include practical next steps (e.g., confirm diagnosis severity, optimize guideline-based pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacologic interventions, vaccinations, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab, follow-up/monitoring). Mention key guideline sources where appropriate. Avoid hallucinated citations; if specific evidence is uncertain, state uncertainty and suggest where to verify."}
{"input": {"patient_id": "P002", "question": "What are the latest clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?"}, "reference": "Rubric / expectations: Summarize how to identify current IPF clinical trials and what categories are active (e.g., antifibrotic pathways, anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic agents). Provide actionable guidance: search registries (ClinicalTrials.gov), key inclusion/exclusion considerations, endpoints, and how to refer/enroll. Avoid fabricating trial names/IDs; if uncertain, explain how to verify and suggest reputable sources."}
