If medications are present, summarize them clearly (name, dose if available, start/stop if available) and ideally cite note date/source. If medications are not found in the notes context, explicitly say so and suggest what to check next (med list, pharmacy records, or specific visit note)."}

If the last CXR findings are present, summarize key impression elements and date. If not available in retrieved notes, state uncertainty and suggest where to locate the imaging report (radiology system, note attachments, ordering encounter)."}
