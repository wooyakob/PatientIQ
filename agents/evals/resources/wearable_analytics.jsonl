Highlight urgent/critical issues if present, but avoid inventing vitals or diagnoses. If data is missing or insufficient, explicitly say so. Include actionable next steps (e.g., confirm symptoms, consider pulse ox verification, review meds/adherence, follow-up or urgent evaluation depending on severity)."}

Avoid fabricating cohort statistics; if only heuristic comparison is available, state that. Call out any critical alerts. Provide clear guidance on interpretation and what to verify clinically."}
